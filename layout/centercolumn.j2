                    The Cambridge Basketball Academy offers high quality basketball instruction and English language training
                    combined with a culturally immersive and comprehensive tour of Boston area Educational Institutions
                    and historical sites. Several Camp sessions are typically offered each summer as well as during holiday
                    school breaks. Taking advantage of our prime location within the “educational and research capital of
                    the world,” <u>international campers are paired with local basketball players their own age</u> to create a
                    camp experience with no equal!
