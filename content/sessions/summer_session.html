<p>The Summer Break Camp is CBA&#39;s premier offering.
    Play the maximum amount of basketball during the day, and be paired with
    a current local area student-mentor by night from one of Boston&#39;s most
    famous universities such as Harvard or MIT.

<p>
    This is an unbeatable combination for students who are visiting the US for the
    first time, just arriving to study for the first year, or returning to the US
    for another school year. Either way, this camp will offer you something very unique.
