    English Language training at CBA is offered in 3 different levels; Beginner, Intermediate and Upper

    Intermediate. Students arrive at class in the midst of the typical hustle and bustle of Cambridge

    Academia life. As Professors and students of Harvard, MIT and other world class institutions awaken

    to get to class in the morning, so too will CBA campers. Our expert ESL instructors will provide a

    structured and comprehensive course with an emphasis on speaking. Students will interact with each

    other during class, and will be immediately able to practice their new communication skills on the

    basketball court with local American students, as well as in the Boston area on one of our many

    exciting excursions.

    At the end of the session, students will receive a certificate of completion and top students will be

    recognized at each level.
