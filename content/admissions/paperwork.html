<h2>Health Insurance</h2>

<p>

    Participants in the CBA are required to have health insurance that is written by a
    company in the U.S.  Short term health insurance is offered by many U.S. companies
    such as USI Affinity Travel Services ( <a target="_blank" href="http://www.travelinsure.com">www.travelinsure.com</a> ) or
    ISM (<a  target="_blank" href="https://secure.visit-aci.com/insurance/ISM/Start.aspx">https://secure.visit-aci.com/insurance/ISM/Start.aspx</a> )
    Short term health insurance is necessary to pay for any medical attention you
    might need beyond that offered at the Student Health Center.
    Please remember that while Travel Insurance may assist you with travel costs
    in the event of an emergency many policies do not cover medical bills.
    You will be required to submit proof of U.S.-based health insurance after
    admission to the Academy
