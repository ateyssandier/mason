<h2>Health Insurance</h2>

<p>

    Participants in the CBA are required to have health insurance that is written by a
    company in the U.S.  Short term health insurance is offered by many U.S. companies
    such as USI Affinity Travel Services ( www.travelinsure.com ) or
    ISM (https://secure.visit-aci.com/insurance/ISM/Start.aspx)
    Short term health insurance is necessary to pay for any medical attention you
    might need beyond that offered at the Student Health Center.
    Please remember that while “Travel Insurance” may assist you with travel costs
    in the event of an emergency many policies do not cover medical bills.
    You will be required to submit proof of U.S.-based health insurance after
    admission to the Academy


    All students must arrive at CBA fully insured (with copy of policy) and with the proper Documents
    (I-20, I-94, and Passport)
    You will not be permitted to participate in the Camp until all of these documents are verified by CBA staff.
    This is in addition to the previously mentioned Physical and Immunization Form.
    In addition, any student found without said documents could be subject to expulsion from the Camp without refund.
</p>

<p>
    A recent (within the last two years) Physical and Immunization Form is required prior to admittance to camp.
    A camper will not be allowed to attend or participate in camp unless the physicians form has been received.
</p>

<p>A full-time certified athletic trainer is on site at all times at each camp during camp hours.</p>
